        <h3>Descripton:</h3>
        <p>Chole bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpea curry (chole) 
            served with deep-fried bread (bhature). 
            To prepare the chole, start by soaking dried chickpeas overnight, 
            then boiling them until tender. In a separate pan, sauté onions, ginger, garlic, 
            and spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala until fragrant. Add tomatoes, 
            cooked chickpeas, and water, then simmer until the flavors meld and the sauce thickens. 
            Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.</p>
        <p>For the bhature, combine all-purpose flour, yogurt, baking powder, salt, 
            and a touch of sugar to form a smooth dough. 
            Let it rest, then divide and roll out portions into circles. 
            Deep-fry the dough until golden and puffy, achieving a crispy exterior with a soft interior. 
            Serve the piping hot bhature alongside the aromatic chole for a delightful 
            culinary experience that combines bold flavors and contrasting textures.</p>
